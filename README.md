If the server starts successfully, you'll see the following output:

```
2024-12-04 14:32:45.584 [main] INFO  Application - Application started in 0.303 seconds.
2024-12-04 14:32:45.682 [main] INFO  Application - Responding at http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

## Private API Authentication

Private endpoints under `/file/*` are served by the private server on port `9001` and require a bearer token.
Public routes on port `9000` do not use this `Authorization` header requirement.

- Set `PRIVATE_API_TOKEN` before starting the server.
- Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` only on requests to the private server (`http://localhost:9001/file/*`).

Example:

```bash
PRIVATE_API_TOKEN=my-secret-token ./gradlew run
```

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer my-secret-token" \
  --data-binary "hello" \
  http://localhost:9001/file/example.txt
```
